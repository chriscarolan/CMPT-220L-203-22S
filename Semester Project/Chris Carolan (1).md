I made a project where you could create a binary tree that will order values you put in and traverse or search through it in all different kinds of ways.

You can search for it in many different ways like
- Finding an element
- Finding the smallest/biggest element
- Finding specific "kth biggest" elements.

Also, you can manipulate the tree by 
- Deleting elements
- Reorganizing the tree

You can traverse the tree by listing elements 
- inorder
- postorder
- preorder

And finally, there are advanced searches where you can search by
- Depth first search(DFS)
- Breadth first search(BFS)

To work with the tree, look in the main file and adjust the 'tree.insert' where you can change the values of the keys. This will allow you to adjust the tree as you want, and see how the results print out when looking for specific parts like the hight of the tree or the smallest number in the tree, and many other things.
