I wanted to make it so the user could easily input the individual pieces of each order, which included the 
- tip
- pretzel
- lemonade

To do this I used scanner so that there was a prompt on each line that allowed to user to enter this data in the order of 
1. Lemonade(s) purchased
2. Pretzel(s) purchased
3. Tip amount

I took this lab as almost a csh register type of code where it could calculate everything it had given adnd gave away, and give you the numbers of everything you had left, in terms of money, stock, etc.
